queen can't beat many checkers per turn;
you can't differ enemy queen from the other checkers;
there is no finish message;
there are no unit tests =);
the window is cliping, while moving checker;
there is no cancel button on connect prompt.

for the rest, program works almost properly =)

run tips:
***
you may require two DLLs (msvcp100d and msvcr100d)
to run the program. you can find them at "\Debug\DLL".
theese must be located in both "c:\windows\system"
and "c:\windows\system32" folders. third dll performs
winsockets support and can't be at the same level with
program .exe file;
***
program can connect to a LAN host. for "online" game
install hamachi.msi, create a network with another
player and use the address that hamachi will give you.
